# Interface :-

- Interface is a way to define a `contract` for the shape of an object.
- It specifies the `properties and their types that an object must have`.
- Interfaces are a powerful tool for enforcing a certain structure in your code.

-here is the example of the Interface

```ts
// Interface Definition
interface person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string;
}

// Usage
const John:person = {
    name:"Jhon",
    age:"20,
    email:"jhon@test.com"
}
```

- While interfaces are commonly used to define the structure ob objects, they `are not limited to just objects`.
- Interfaces in Typescript can also be used to `describe the shape` of function and classes.
