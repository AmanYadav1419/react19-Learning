## useEffect

- useEffect Hook allows you to perform `side effects` in your components.
- Some examples of side effects are : fetching data, directly updating DOM etc.

- here is the syntax will look like 👇

  - for that first we are using useEffect hook name.
  - then passing the callback function to it.
  - and inside that callback function you can do anything you want.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Do your magic
}, []);
```

- but there are few things you need to keep it in your mind when working with useEffect Hook.

  - 1. Without the array ➡ on every single render
       (whenevery we don't specifcy the dependency array , then the callback function will call on every single render).
  - 2. let's talk about useEffect with conditionals so, you can't wrapp your hook inside the conditionals statement for e.g

  ```jsx
  // ❌❌❌
  if (value > 0) {
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log("call useEffect");
      document.title = `Increment (${value})`;
    });
  }
  ```

  - so if you want to use conditionals statement , you need to use inside the useEffect Hook for e.g 👇

  ```jsx
  // ✅✅✅
  useEffect(() => {
    if (value > 0) {
      console.log("call useEffect");
      document.title = `Increment (${value})`;
    }
  });
  ```

  - 3. now the final things you need to keep in mind is that :-
  - anytime we specifcy the empty dependency array for our useEffect it will only fired that function which is available inside our useEffect hook for the initial render like when our component first render it will call the function.
  - here is the example code ✅

  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("call useEffect");
    if (value > 0) {
      document.title = `Increment (${value})`;
    }
  }, []);
  ```

  - but if create some sort of state and we provided that value of the state to dependency array, so anytime that state changes , that component will re-render and that callback function excute.
  - here is the example code ✅

  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("call useEffect");
    if (value > 0) {
      document.title = `Increment (${value})`;
    }
  }, [value]);
  ```

- so we setup useEffect Hook to run our code WHEN ,
  - 👉 Component renders for the (First Time)
  - 👉 & WHENEVER it renders
  - 👉 & some data in our component changed.
  - 👉 & empty dependency array means to run the code only once , once the component get renderd.

## Let's understand the useEffect Hook by practical demo :- 01 Data Fetching:-

- here is the code 👇

```jsx
// This component is for to understand the practical use-case of useEffect hook :- 01 :- Data Fetching
// to use this component , import the `DataFetching` component to `App.jsx` file.
// in this i am not writings more comments anymore now you are matured enough and now you can understand the useState better.
// just writing some comments where it is necessary.

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const DataFetching = () => {
  // to fetch our data for that we first have to create states to put our data.
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  // now we are using the useEffect hook with passing callback function and also the empty dependency array.
  // this empty dependency array simply means that useEffect will runs only once.
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getData() {
      // first fetching the data and storing it in variable.
      const response = await fetch(
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
      );
      // then converting it into json and storing it in variable.
      const jsonResponse = await response.json();

      // and then first checking that data is present or not,
      // and then storing this json converted data to the state.
      if (jsonResponse && jsonResponse.data > 0) {
        setData(jsonResponse);
      }
    }

    // now we have to call the function to excute the function
    getData();
  }, []);

  // now we have to render the data to ui.
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((post) => (
          <section key={post.id}>
            <li>Title :---- {post.title}</li>
            <li>Body :------ {post.body}</li>
          </section>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetching;
```

## Excercise :- Understanding useEffect in React.
- In this excercise, you'll practice using the `useEffect` hook in different scenarios, including fetching data, handling side effects.

Step 1 :- Basic usage of `useEffect`
      1. Create a new file called `BasicEffect.jsx`.
      2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `BasicEffect`.
      3. Use `useEffect` to log a message to the console whenever the components mounts (i.e, when it's renderd the first time).

Step 2 :- `useEffect` with Dependencies
      1. Create a new file called `CounterEffect.jsx`.
      2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `CounterEffect`.
      3. Use `useEffect` to update the document title whenever a counter value changes.
        - initialize a `count` state with `0` using `useState`.
        - Render a button that Increments the count.
        - Use `useEffect` to update the document title whenever `count` changes.

Step 3 :- `useEffect` for Fetching Data
      1. Create a new file called `FetchDataEffect.jsx`.
      2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `FetchDataEffect`.
      3. Use `useEffect` to fetch data from an API when the component mounts.
        - Use the API endpoint `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` to fetch some data.
        - Store the data in a state variable and display the title of the first post.
