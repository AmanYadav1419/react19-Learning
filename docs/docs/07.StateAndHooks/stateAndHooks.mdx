## STATE

- State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time and affects how the component renders.
- We define state using `useState` Hook, which allows you to set an initial value and provides a way to update that state.

- this says the word `Hook` , so what are hooks and why should we care about that.

## HOOKS

- Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8.
- They let you use state and other React features without writing a class (or to be specific `class based component`).
- Hooks are allowed to manage our state inside the functional component.
- and there are alot of `Hooks` in React, but for now we are now covering about `useState` Hook.

## useState() Hook :-

- useState Hook allows us to track state in a functional component.
- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
- So for using Hook in our functional component we need to import the hook from react.

- here how the syntax will look like ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
const [data, changeData] = useState();
```


- note :- anytime we change the value of our state by using the setCount method or any set method, it's gonna re-render our application.
