## ConditionalRendering

- Conditional rendering allows us to `dynamically display` different UI Components or content based on specific conditions.
- This enables us to create more interactive and responsive user experiences.

- There are few ways to Conditionally render our UI ðŸ‘‡

- 1st way :-
  To use `if` and `else` statement.
- 2nd way :-
  To use `Ternary` operator.
- 3rd way :-
  To use `&&` (and) operator.

- so now talk about the 1st one, which is `if and else statement` with example code :-

- here is the code :-
- so at first we have two Components / functions named as ValidPassword and InValidPassword ðŸ‘‡.

  ```jsx
  const ValidPassword = () => <h1>Valid Password</h1>;
  const InValidPassword = () => <h1>InValid Password</h1>;
  ```

- and now we are gonna create yet another Password Component. ðŸ‘‡

- and so we are reciveing the isValid prop to inside Password Component.
- and then we are gona provide our check.

- if the isValid prop value is true , then we are gona return ValidPassword Component.
- and if that not gonna the case then we return InValidPassword Component.

```jsx
const Password = ({ isValid }) => {
  if (isValid) {
    return <ValidPassword />;
  } else {
    return <InValidPassword />;
  }
};
```

- here is the more better and refactor version , to don't use if and else statement.
- so we use javascript Ternary ðŸ‘‡

- if the isValid prop value is true , then we are gona return ValidPassword Component.
- and if that not gonna the case then we return InValidPassword Component.

```jsx
const Password = ({ isValid }) => {
  return isValid ? <ValidPassword /> : <InValidPassword />;
};
```

- and then we are gona calling that to our `App.jsx` Component. ðŸ‘‡
- and now inside that App Component we are passing isValid prop to it and that gonna set to be true.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <Password isValid={true} />;
};
```

- here is another example

- i have a Cart Component, inside that i had items
- and then now i am checking if the length of items is greater than 0 , then we are gonna display the ui.
- and if that is not the case , like if we don't have any item inside the items array that's not gona show us anything.

```jsx
const Cart = () => {
  const items = ["Wireless earbuds", "Power bank", "New SSD", "Hoddie"];

  return (
    <>
    {
      items.length > 0 && <h2>You have {items.length} items in your cart. </h2>
    }

    <ul>
    <h4>Products ðŸ‘‡<h4>
    {
      items.map((item) => {
        return <li key={Math.random()}>{item}</li>
      })}
    </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default Cart;
```

## Excercise :- Conditional Rendering in React.

- in this excercise, you will practise different ways to render JSX Conditionally in React Components.

Step 1 : Create a `Weather` Component with if, else if and else.

1. Create a new file called `Weather.jsx`.
2. Inside this file create a functional component called Weather.
3. The component should:

   - The temperature prop
   - Use if, else if and else statements to Conditionally render different messages based on the temperature values:
     - if the temperature is below 15, display: "it's cold outside!"
     - if the temperature is between 15 and 25, display: "it's nice outside!"
     - if the temperature is above 25, display: "it's hot outside!"

Step 2 : Create a `UserStatus` Component with the `&&` Operator

1. Create a new file called `UserStatus.jsx`.
2. Inside this file create a functional component called UserStatus.
3. The Component should:

   - Take two boolean props loggedIn, isAdmin.
   - Use the && operator to display a message for Admin & Normal User:
     - if loggedIn is true and isAdmin display: "Welcome Admin!".
     - if it's just loggedIn and not admin then display: "Welcome User!".

Step 3 : Create a `ConditionalGreeting` Component with a Ternary Operator

1. Create a new file called ConditionalGreeting.jsx.
2. Inside this file create a functional component called ConditionalGreeting.
3. The Component should:

   - Take a timeOfDay prop (e.g "morning", "afternoon")
   - Use the ternary operator to ConditionalRendering display different greetings based on the time of day:
     - if timeOfDay is "morning", display: "Good morning!"
     - if timeOfDay is "afternoon", display: "Good afternoon!"

Step 4 : Render the Components in `App.jsx`

1. In your App.jsx file, import the Weather, UserStatus and ConditionalGreeting components:

- (note that this import statements are according to my folder structure , it can be change according to your folder structure. )

```jsx
import Weather from "./components/05.conditionalRendering/Weather";
import UserStatus from "./components/05.conditionalRendering/UserStatus";
import ConditionalGreeting from "./components/05.conditionalRendering/ConditionalGreeting";
```

2. Inside the App component's return statement, render each component with different props to test the conditional rendering logic.

Example :

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Conditional Rendering in React</h1>
      {/* Weather component */}
      <Weather temperature={10} />
      <Weather temperature={20} />
      <Weather temperature={30} />

      {/* UserStatus component */}
      <UserStatus loggedIn={true}/>
      <UserStatus loggedIn={false}/>

      {/* ConditionalGreeting component */}
      <ConditionalGreeting timeOfDay="morning"/>
      <ConditionalGreeting timeOfDay="afternoon"/>
      <ConditionalGreeting />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
