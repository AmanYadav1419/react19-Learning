## ConditionalRendering

- Conditional rendering allows us to `dynamically display` different UI Components or content based on specific conditions.
- This enables us to create more interactive and responsive user experiences.

- There are few ways to Conditionally render our UI ğŸ‘‡

- 1st way :-
  To use `if` and `else` statement.
- 2nd way :-
  To use `Ternary` operator.
- 3rd way :-
  To use `&&` (and) operator.

- so now talk about the 1st one, which is `if and else statement` with example code :-

- here is the code :-
- so at first we have two Components / functions named as ValidPassword and InValidPassword ğŸ‘‡.

  ```jsx
  const ValidPassword = () => <h1>Valid Password</h1>;
  const InValidPassword = () => <h1>InValid Password</h1>;
  ```

- and now we are gonna create yet another Password Component. ğŸ‘‡

- and so we are reciveing the isValid prop to inside Password Component.
- and then we are gona provide our check.

- if the isValid prop value is true , then we are gona return ValidPassword Component.
- and if that not gonna the case then we return InValidPassword Component.

```jsx
const Password = ({ isValid }) => {
  if (isValid) {
    return <ValidPassword />;
  } else {
    return <InValidPassword />;
  }
};
```

- here is the more better and refactor version , to don't use if and else statement.
- so we use javascript Ternary ğŸ‘‡

- if the isValid prop value is true , then we are gona return ValidPassword Component.
- and if that not gonna the case then we return InValidPassword Component.

```jsx
const Password = ({ isValid }) => {
  return isValid ? <ValidPassword /> : <InValidPassword />;
};
```

- and then we are gona calling that to our `App.jsx` Component. ğŸ‘‡
- and now inside that App Component we are passing isValid prop to it and that gonna set to be true.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <Password isValid={true} />;
};
```

- here is another example

- i have a Cart Component, inside that i had items
- and then now i am checking if the length of items is greater than 0 , then we are gonna display the ui.
- and if that is not the case , like if we don't have any item inside the items array that's not gona show us anything.

```jsx
const Cart = () => {
  const items = ["Wireless earbuds", "Power bank", "New SSD", "Hoddie"];

  return (
    <>
    {
      items.length > 0 && <h2>You have {items.length} items in your cart. </h2>
    }

    <ul>
    <h4>Products ğŸ‘‡<h4>
    {
      items.map((item) => {
        return <li key={Math.random()}>{item}</li>
      })}
    </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default Cart;
```
