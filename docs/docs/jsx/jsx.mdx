## JSX

- it is basically Javascript and Xml .

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write & add HTML in React.

This how our looks like :

- first of all we have our component

```jsx
const Component = () => {};
```

- and inside our component , we are now returning some HTML

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <section id="section">
      <h1>My Website</h1>

      <article>
        <h2>Welcome to React.</h2>
        <p className="text">Here is Paragraph Content</p>
      </article>
    </section>
  );
};
```

so why we called it as jsx not html :-
- this is just of illusion of html code , this is not html code.
- behind the scene React will compile the code into Pure Javascript.


# JSX Excercise :- 
In this excercise, you will practice writing basic JSX code and rendering into React app.

Step 1 : Create a new Component
    1. Create a new file called WelcomeMessage.jsx
    2. Inside this file write a functional component called WelcomeMessage.
    3. The component should return a <div> that contains:
        - A <h1> element that displays the message:  "Hello, World!"
        - A <p> element that displays the message: "Welcome to learning JSX!!"

Step 2 : Render the component in App.jsx 
    1. Open the App.jsx file.
    2. Import the WelcomeMessage component at the top of the file.
    3. Inside the App component's return statment, render the

Step 3 : Run the Application
    1. Run the app in your development environment.
    2. You should see the "Hello, World!" message along with the "Welcome to learning JSX!!" displayed in your browser.
