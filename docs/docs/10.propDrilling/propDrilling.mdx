## Prop Drilling :-

- this is the most famous problem in ReactJS
- so what is prop drilling and why should we care about that.

- To avoid the heavy prop drilling we will learning throughout the course and using it , the names are :-

  - Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Context API , there are alot ways.

- but now let's talk about prop drilling :-

  - we are getting data to the `App` component and passing this data to every single component via `prop`.
  - here is how the data will pass component by component (component names are written) :-
    ` `App`=>`Card`=>`Users`=>`Date` `

- so imagine you're working in a mnc company or the big project , in that project you have alot, alot components for example say thousand components.
- so did you think that drilling prop data to every single prop is good practise or it is even possible to do that.
- now there is solution for that , i will show that solution after some time in this project only.
- but first of all i wana show you prop drilling in action, before going to solution :-

- here is the code of the prop drilling so you understand better ðŸ‘‡

- ComponentA code :-

```jsx
import ComponentB from "./ComponentB";

// now inside ComponentA , accepting the name prop with destructring getting it from App Component.
const ComponentA = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    // and then we are just passing the name prop to the ComponentB
    <div>
      <ComponentB name={name} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentA;
```

- ComponentB code :-

```jsx
import ComponentC from "./ComponentC";

// now inside ComponentB , accepting the name prop with destructring getting it from ComponentA.
const ComponentB = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    // and then we are just passing the name prop to the ComponentC
    <div>
      <ComponentC name={name} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentB;
```

- ComponentC code :-

```jsx
// now inside ComponentC , accepting the name prop with destructring getting it from ComponentB.
const ComponentC = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    // and then finally we are rendering name prop to the ComponentC
    <div>
      <h1>Getting My {name} by Prop Drilling.</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentC;
```

- so just passing a name to the componentC , where it acutally used we have to pass the prop on other components as well
- so just imagine if we have thousands of components , so how much it is heavy to just drill the prop to every single component
- and still it doesn't need to pass to un-neccessary component.

- so to solve this problem we are gonna learning next is `ContextAPI` in React.
