## Props

    - Props / Properties are arguments passed into React components.
    - Props allows us to pass data from parent component to a child component.
    - Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

### 1. for example here is below code shows that what are props and how they work. this is just for understanding try to do it own with exporting the component and using it.

- so basically the App component is parent component , and we are passing data like image, name, age etc.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <User
      img="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85052811?v=4"
      name="Aman Yadav"
      age={21}
      isMarried={false}
      hobbies={["Coding", "Cricket", "Reading"]}
    />
  );
};
```

- here is the User component code to recieve this above data coming from parent component.
  - first of all we are taking props as parameter
  - and then we are accessing the data using dot(.) notations
  - here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡.

```jsx
const User = (props) => {
  return (
    <section>
      <img src={props.img} alt={props.name} width={200} />
      <h1>Name :- {props.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age :- {props.age}</h2>
      <h3>Is Married :- {props.isMarried}</h3>
      <h4>Hobbies :- {props.hobbies}</h4>
    </section>
  );
};
```

- here is the another version with having props destructuring , and making code more clear and easy readable.
  - for that in params we write the names of parameters passed instead writing props
  - and still all the code works correctly.
  - here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡.

```jsx
const User = ({ img, name, age, isMarried, hobbies }) => {
  return (
    <section>
      <img src={img} alt={name} width={200} />
      <h1>Name :- {name}</h1>
      <h2>Age :- {age}</h2>
      <h3>Is Married :- {isMarried}</h3>
      <h4>Hobbies :- {hobbies}</h4>
    </section>
  );
};
```

## Excercise : Using Props in React Components
- in this excercise, you will learn how to pass and use props in React components to make them dynamic and reusable.

Step 1 : Create a Person Component
  1. Create a new file called Person.jsx.
  2. Inside this file, create a functional component called Person.
  3. This component should accept props and render:
    - A <h2> element that displays the person's name.
    - A <p> element that displays the person's age.
  4. Use props.name and props.age to display the dynamic values passed from the parent component.

Step 2 : Create a Product Component 
  1. Create a new file called Product.jsx.
  2. Inside this file, create a functional component called Product.
  3. This component should accept props and render:
    - A <h2> element that displays the product's name.
    - A <p> element that displays the product's price.
  4. Use props.name and props.price to display the dynamic values passed from the parent component.

Step 3 : Pass Props from App.jsx
  1. In Your App.jsx file, import the Person and Product components: 
 
  ```jsx 
  import Person from "./components/Person";
  import Product from "./components/Product";
  ```

  2. Inside the App component, pass dynamic data as props to both Person and Product components:
    - Pass name and age as props to the Person component.
    - Pass name and price as props to the Product component.
