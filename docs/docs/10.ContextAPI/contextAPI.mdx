## Context API :-

- to solve the Problem of `prop drilling` we used `Context API`.
- Context API is a feature that allows you to `manage and share state` across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- It's useful for scenarios where you need to share data or functions across many components, especially when these component are deeply nested.
