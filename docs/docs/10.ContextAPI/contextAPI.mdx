## Context API :-

- to solve the Problem of `prop drilling` we used `Context API`.
- Context API is a feature that allows you to `manage and share state` across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- It's useful for scenarios where you need to share data or functions across many components, especially when these component are deeply nested.

- steps to Create and use Context in react js :-

  1. first import the `createContext` from react.

     ```jsx
     import { createContext } from "react";
     ```

  2. now we have to store this `createContext` to a variable and export that so that i can use this Context anywhere inside my project.

     ```jsx
     export const Data = createContext();
     ```

  3. so now i need to wrap my entire application to use this Context

     - then we have to property's :- `.Provider` that means it's gonna allows us to provide our value or our data to multiple components.
     - and then we have to use `value={}` and inside our `value={}` we have to pass data , that need to pass inside our component or application.

       ```jsx
       return (
         <Data.Provider value={name}>
           <ComponentA />
         </Data.Provider>
       );
       ```

  4. now how we are gonna reciving the data coming from Context.
     - so for that , where we want to recvie the data we have to import the Context whether we declare the context.
     ```jsx
     import { Data } from "./componentName";
     ```

  - so now wrap up with the Data component in the reciving component.

        - and passing the property :- `Consumer` to the Data Component, `Consumer` is used to consume the data or recvie the data.
        - now this Consumer will take a callback function so now we are passing a function inside that to get our data.

        ```jsx
        return (
          <Data.Consumer>
            {(name) => {
              return <h1>My Name is :- {name}</h1>;
            }}
          </Data.Consumer>
        );
        ```

        - here is the live code example of the ContextAPI code :- ðŸ‘‡
            - first file i.e ParentComponent.jsx i.e for the creating context and sending Data to the reciver component.

            ```jsx
        import { createContext } from "react";
        import ComponentA from "./ComponentA";

        export const Data = createContext();

            const ParentComponent = () => {
            const name = "Aman Yadav From ContextAPI";

                return (
                    <Data.Provider value={name}>
                        <ComponentA />
                    </Data.Provider>
                );
            };

        export default ParentComponent;
        ```

    - second file i.e ComponentA.jsx i.e for the reciving context to the component and rendering to the UI.

    ```jsx
    import { Data } from "./ParentComponent";

    const ComponentA = () => {
      return (
        <Data.Consumer>
          {(name) => {
            return <h1>My name is :- {name}</h1>;
          }}
        </Data.Consumer>
      );
    };

    export default ComponentA;
    ```
