## PORTAL

- Portal is a feature that allows you to render a child component into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of parent componet.
- This can be useful for scenarios like `modals`, `tooltips`, or `dropdowns`, where you want to break out of the ususal parent-child structure and render in a different part of the DOM.

- for the code part to understand it better
- here is the first example of portals to understand ,
- code is present of `CopyInput.jsx` file inside `8.Portal` folder.
- still here is the code for better understanding ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
// to use this component , import the `CopyInput` component to `App.jsx` file.
// this file is for to understand the portals concept by example number 1.
// in this i am not writings more comments anymore now you are matured enough and now you can understand the useState better.
// just writing some comments where it is necessary.

import { useState } from "react";

// so for starting i am creating the basic component

const CopyInput = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false);

  // function that will do the task, excute after onclick event happes on button
  const handleCopy = () => {
    // so for copying the text we use navigator inbuilt javascript method/function
    // and after that we are using .then() method to delay
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(inputValue).then(() => {
      setCopied(true);

      // after that we have to set the value of copied state to false to copy the text again or upadating the ui
      // and we have provided 2 seconds delay , so after 2 seconds it will make the setCopied state false
      setTimeout(() => {
        setCopied(false);
      }, 5000);
    });
  };

  // now get to render ui part.
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />

      <button onClick={handleCopy}>Copy</button>

      {/* passing copied prop as copied to PopupContent */}
      <PopupContent copied={copied} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CopyInput;
```

- and here is the `PopupContent.jsx` file code with comments explanation ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
// in this i am not writings more comments anymore now you are matured enough and now you can understand the useState better.
// just writing some comments where it is necessary.

// so if we don't want to add this component to dom tree how we can do that
// so by importing react portals and we are getting this from react-dom
import { createPortal } from "react-dom";

// in that we are accepting `copied` prop and destrcuture it , it is coming from `CopyInput.jsx` file
const PopupContent = ({ copied }) => {
  // so to use portal we write createPortal and it has two parameters
  // first one is the content that we want to render and second one is the target where we want to render that content
  // so we are using `document.getElementById("portal-root")` as target
  // so we are sepreateing by using comma so that we can write the content in next line

  return createPortal(
    <section>
      {/* if the copied is true then we just want to display the below ui */}
      {copied && (
        // with that i also want to add some styling to this div
        <div
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            bottom: "3rem",
            color: "aliceblue",
          }}
        >
          Copied to Clipboard
        </div>
      )}
    </section>,
    // this is the target where we want to render the content
    document.querySelector("#popup-content-root")
  );
};

export default PopupContent;
```

- so to use portal we write createPortal and it has two parameters
- first one is the content that we want to render and second one is the target where we want to render that content
- so we are using `document.getElementById("portal-root")` as target
- so we are sepreateing by using comma so that we can write the content in next line
