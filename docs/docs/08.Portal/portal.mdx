## PORTAL

- Portal is a feature that allows you to render a child component into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of parent componet.
- This can be useful for scenarios like `modals`, `tooltips`, or `dropdowns`, where you want to break out of the ususal parent-child structure and render in a different part of the DOM.
