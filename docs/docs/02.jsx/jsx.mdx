## JSX

- it is basically Javascript and Xml .

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write & add HTML in React.

This how our looks like :

- first of all we have our component

```jsx
const Component = () => {};
```

- and inside our component , we are now returning some HTML

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <section id="section">
      <h1>My Website</h1>

      <article>
        <h2>Welcome to React.</h2>
        <p className="text">Here is Paragraph Content</p>
      </article>
    </section>
  );
};
```

so why we called it as jsx not html :-
- this is just of illusion of html code , this is not html code.
- behind the scene React will compile the code into Pure Javascript.


## JSX Excercise :- 
In this excercise, you will practice writing basic JSX code and rendering into React app.

Step 1 : Create a new Component
    1. Create a new file called WelcomeMessage.jsx
    2. Inside this file write a functional component called WelcomeMessage.
    3. The component should return a <div> that contains:
        - A <h1> element that displays the message:  "Hello, World!"
        - A <p> element that displays the message: "Welcome to learning JSX!!"

Step 2 : Render the component in App.jsx 
    1. Open the App.jsx file.
    2. Import the WelcomeMessage component at the top of the file.
    3. Inside the App component's return statment, render the

Step 3 : Run the Application
    1. Run the app in your development environment.
    2. You should see the "Hello, World!" message along with the "Welcome to learning JSX!!" displayed in your browser.


## Rules to Write JSX :-
1. From a single component you are allowed to return only one Parent element e.g <div> or <section>.
    - and inside that Parent element you can create multiple child elements nested
2. In JSX you have to close all of your HTML tags.
3. You are not allowed to Provide class by using class keyword, instead of class you have to provide className.
4. anytime you are working with the forms in some situation we also want to provide some label for our input feilds
    - in <form> tag we are creating <label />,
    - and in that label instead of write for="" property present in HTML
    - we write like this :- htmlFor=""
    - so here is with example :- 
        <form>
            <label htmlFor="name">Name : </label>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Your Name" />
        </form>


## JSX Rules Excercise :- 

Step 1 : Create a new Component
    1. Create a new file called JSXRules.jsx
    2. Inside this file, write a functional component called JSXRules.

    The component should return a <div> containing the following
    - A <h1> element with the text "JSX Rules"
    - A Paragraph (<p>) that lists at least three rules of JSX:
        - JSX must return a single parent element.
        - JSX element must be properly closed.
        - JSX attributes are written using camelCase (e.g. className instead of class). 

Step 2 : Render the component in App.jsx 
    1. Open the App.jsx file.
    2. Import the JSXRules component at the top of the file.
    3. Inside the App component's return statment, render the

Step 3 : Run the Application
    1. Run the app in your development environment.
    2. You should see the "JSX Rules" message along with all that three rules of JSX.

## Expressions in JSX
- so with JSX you can write expressions in curly braces. The expressions can be React variable or property,
or any other valid Javascript expression. JSX will excute the expression and return result.

here is the example present in JSXexpression.jsx

## Excercise :Using dynamic Content with {} JSX
- in this excercise, you will learn how to inject dynamic data using curly braces {}.

Step 1 : Create a Greeting Component
    1. Create a new file called Greeting.jsx 
    2. Inside this file, Create a functional component named Greeting.
    3. The Greeting component should return a <div> containing:
        - A <h1> element that dynamically displays a greeting message.
        - A <p> element that dynamically displays current date.
    4. Use Javascript expression inside {} to dynamically render the following:
        - A name variable containing a name, such as "John".
        - A new Date() object to displays current date.

Step 2 : Create a ProductInfo Component
    1. Create a new file called ProductInfo.jsx.
    2. Inside this file, creaate a functional component named ProductInfo.
    3. The ProductInfo component should return a <div> that dynamically displays Product details:
        - Use the Product object that contains following properties:
            - name:"Laptop",
            - price:"$1200",
            - availbility:"In Stock"
    4. Display the Product name , price and availbility using {}.

Step 3 : Render Components in App.jsx 
    1. In your App.jsx file, import the Greeting and ProductInfo Components:

    ```jsx
    import Greeting from "./components/Greeting";
    import ProductInfo from "./components/ProductInfo";
    ```

    2. Inside the App component's return statment, render both the component.
    ```jsx
    function App(){
        return (
        <div>
            <Greeting />
            <ProductInfo />
        </div>
        );
    }
    export default App
    ```
