## Styling in React

### 1) Providing Styling in Component `Inline`.

- There are alot ways to style our react component , but in this specific section we are only learn about the basics ,
- But Later in this course we are gonna also learning about popular libraries like radix, daisy ui and tailwindcss , shadcn ui and stuff like that.
- But for now we are only learning about the basics of Styling

- here is one example of method or way to apply styling to react component.

- if i want to apply some sort of `styling` to the `h1`,
- so i will use a `style` attribute and then `=` and then `{{}}` (double curly brackets). you have to keep that mind.
- and inside the opening double curly brackets now you can write all of your css or styling which is present in css.

- one thing you have to `remember that is you cannot write your normal css in react` i.e `background-color` like this
- this is not a css this is react js , so you need to write the background-color property in react like this `backgroundColor`

- anytime we have some sort of property have two name like `background` and also the `color` so we are not gonna provide `spaces` and `dashes` and also we are not allowed to write in `lowercase` or in totally `uppercase`.
- we have to write that as a `one word` and also we have to write that as a `camalCase`.
- and by using comma(,) we can seperate the css properties so that multiple css properties can apply to single element.

- here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡. an example code snippet to understand.

```jsx
const InlineStyling = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1 style={{ color: "white", backgroundColor: "teal", padding: "2rem" }}>
        Inline Styles
      </h1>
    </section>
  );
};

export default InlineStyling;
```

### Styling Passing As Object 

- now let's talk about the second way

- now we can extract the styling from the `h1` element,
- and we can put that in some sort of object and then we can reference that object inside this style.
- for that create a variable for e.g `styles` and then use `=` sign after that using curly brackets `{}`,
- now inside that curly brackets write or paste the code.

- and then copy the variable name and then we have to just place in style attribute,
- but in this case we are not gonna to write double curly brackets `{{}}` ,
- instead we are gonne to be write or working with the single curly brackets `{}`
- so now we are rendering our styling totally dynamically 
- here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
const StylingPassingAsObject = () => {
  const styles = { color: "black", backgroundColor: "crimson", padding: "2rem" };
  return (
    <section>
      <h1 style={styles}>Styling Passing As Object</h1>
    </section>
  );
};

export default StylingPassingAsObject;

```
