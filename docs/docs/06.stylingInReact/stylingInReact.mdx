## Styling in React

### 1) Providing Styling in Component `Inline`.

- There are alot ways to style our react component , but in this specific section we are only learn about the basics ,
- But Later in this course we are gonna also learning about popular libraries like radix, daisy ui and tailwindcss , shadcn ui and stuff like that.
- But for now we are only learning about the basics of Styling

- here is one example of method or way to apply styling to react component.

- if i want to apply some sort of `styling` to the `h1`,
- so i will use a `style` attribute and then `=` and then `{{}}` (double curly brackets). you have to keep that mind.
- and inside the opening double curly brackets now you can write all of your css or styling which is present in css.

- one thing you have to `remember that is you cannot write your normal css in react` i.e `background-color` like this
- this is not a css this is react js , so you need to write the background-color property in react like this `backgroundColor`

- anytime we have some sort of property have two name like `background` and also the `color` so we are not gonna provide `spaces` and `dashes` and also we are not allowed to write in `lowercase` or in totally `uppercase`.
- we have to write that as a `one word` and also we have to write that as a `camalCase`.
- and by using comma(,) we can seperate the css properties so that multiple css properties can apply to single element.

- here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡. an example code snippet to understand.

```jsx
const InlineStyling = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1 style={{ color: "white", backgroundColor: "teal", padding: "2rem" }}>
        Inline Styles
      </h1>
    </section>
  );
};

export default InlineStyling;
```

### Styling Passing As Object

- now let's talk about the second way

- now we can extract the styling from the `h1` element,
- and we can put that in some sort of object and then we can reference that object inside this style.
- for that create a variable for e.g `styles` and then use `=` sign after that using curly brackets `{}`,
- now inside that curly brackets write or paste the code.

- and then copy the variable name and then we have to just place in style attribute,
- but in this case we are not gonna to write double curly brackets `{{}}` ,
- instead we are gonne to be write or working with the single curly brackets `{}`
- so now we are rendering our styling totally dynamically
- here is how we can do this ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
const StylingPassingAsObject = () => {
  const styles = {
    color: "black",
    backgroundColor: "crimson",
    padding: "2rem",
  };
  return (
    <section>
      <h1 style={styles}>Styling Passing As Object</h1>
    </section>
  );
};

export default StylingPassingAsObject;
```

### External CSS file.

- now let me show you one more way using external css file that will be responsible for styling the component.

- for that we are creating a new css file named as `index.css`.
- and now inside this file we are gonna write some css code.
- so we write some code , you check the code in `index.css` file
- after that now we want to use this css code in our react component for that we can use `import` keyword.
- for that where we want to use this css code , we will simply go to the component and on the top
- we will simply import the css file for the component so for that we are importing this css code to `ExternalCSSfile.jsx` component to test it.

- here is code of ExternalCSSfile.jsx component to import css file
- it totally depend on where is your css file is located and what is your folder structure
- in my case css file and component file are in same folder.

```jsx
import "./index.css";
```


## Excercise : Styling Components in React

- In this excercise, you will learn how to apply styles using different methods in React components, including inline styles , style objects and React icons.


Step 1 : Create a `StyledCard` Component with inline Styles
    1. Create a new file called `StyledCard.jsx`.
    2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `StyledCard`.
    3. Use inline styles to style the component:
        - Set the background color to `light blue`.
        - Set padding to `20px`.
        - Set the border radius to `10px`.
        - Set text color to `dark blue`.

    4. Render a `<div>` with a title and description inside it.

Step 2 : Create a `ProfileCard` Component with seperate Style Object
    1. Create a new file called `ProfileCard.jsx`.
    2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `ProfileCard`.
    3. Define a `styles` object to hold the CSS properties:
        - Set the background color to `light grey`.
        - Set padding to `15px`.
        - Set border radius to `8px`.

    4. apply the `styles` object to the `<div>` using the `style` attribute.
    5. Render a `<div>` with a title and description inside it.

Step 3 : Create a `IconComponent`  using React Icons
    1. install `react-icons` if you haven't already:
      ```bash
      npm install react-icons
      ``` 
    2. Create a new file called `IconComponent.jsx`.
    3. Inside this file, create a functional component called `IconComponent`.
    4. Import an icon from `react-icons`, such as `FaBeer` from `react-icons/fa`.
    5. Style the icon using inline styles:
        - Set the font size to `30px`.
        - Set the color to gold.
    6. Render the icon with a title.

Step 4 : Render All Components in App.`jsx`

- `note` : this import totally depend on your project folder structure, in my case it may be differ from your `import` statements , but it's fine it works the same.

    1. In your `App.jsx` file, import the `StyledCard`, `ProfileCard` and `IconComponent` components:
    ```jsx
    import StyledCard from "./components/06.stylingInReact/StyledCard";
    import ProfileCard from "./components/06.stylingInReact/ProfileCard";
    import IconComponent from "./components/06.stylingInReact/IconComponent";
    ```
    2. Inside the `App` component, render all the three components:

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <StyledCard />
          <ProfileCard />
          <IconComponent />
        </div>
      );
    }

  export default App;
```
