## Components

- Components are independent & **reusable** bits of code.
- They serve the same purpose as JS function but work in isolation and return HTML (or return jsx to be precised).

- here are some key takeways to always remeber

  - here are the set of rules need to follow to write **components**

  1. every component should always return some sort of HTML or to be precisly jsx.
  2. the first letter for writing component name should be **Uppercase**, and remaining letter are **lowercase**

  the below code üëá for writing component is bad practise or wrong way ‚ùå

  ```jsx
  function app() {
    return <h1>Hello from app</h1>;
  }
  ```

  the good practise of correct way this üëá‚úÖ

  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return <h1>Hello from App</h1>;
  }
  ```

here are two ways to create components in react

1. by using function reserve keyword

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello from app reserve keyword function component.</h1>;
}
```

2. by using arrow function

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from arrow function component.</h1>;
};
```

now we created components successfully , now we need to tell react to render the component to ui,
for that we use **export** keyword, here is how it works

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from arrow function component.</h1>;
};

export default App;
```

## tasks

here is the first task:-

- create a new file called Greet.jsx and inside that file write Greet using function declartion syntax.
- afterward refactor the Greet component to use the arrow function syntax.
- Finally, register the Greet component in your App.jsx file so that you can see the result when running the app.
