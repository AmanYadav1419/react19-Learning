## Components

- Components are independent & **reusable** bits of code.
- They serve the same purpose as JS function but work in isolation and return HTML (or return jsx to be precised).

- here are some key takeways to always remeber

  - here are the set of rules need to follow to write **components**

  1. every component should always return some sort of HTML or to be precisly jsx.
  2. the first letter for writing component name should be **Uppercase**, and remaining letter are **lowercase**

  the below code üëá for writing component is bad practise or wrong way ‚ùå

  ```jsx
  function app() {
    return <h1>Hello from app</h1>;
  }
  ```

  the good practise of correct way this üëá‚úÖ

  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return <h1>Hello from App</h1>;
  }
  ```

here are two ways to create components in react

1. by using function reserve keyword

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello from app reserve keyword function component.</h1>;
}
```

2. by using arrow function

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from arrow function component.</h1>;
};
```

now we created components successfully , now we need to tell react to render the component to ui,
for that we use **export** keyword, here is how it works

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from arrow function component.</h1>;
};

export default App;
```

## tasks

here is the first task:-

- create a new file called Greet.jsx and inside that file write Greet using function declartion syntax.
- afterward refactor the Greet component to use the arrow function syntax.
- Finally, register the Greet component in your App.jsx file so that you can see the result when running the app.


## Excercise : Rendering Multiple Components and Nesting Components
 - in this excercise, you will learn how to create multiple components and render one component inside another.

 Step 1 : Create a Header Component.
    1. Create a new file called Header.jsx.
    2. Inside this file, create a functional component named Header.
    3. The Header component should return <header> element with the following:
      - A <h1> element with the text "Welcome to My Website!"
      - A <nav> element containing three links (<a>) with the text "Home", "About" and "Contact".

  Step 2 : Create a Footer Component.
    1. Create a new file called Footer.jsx.
    2. Inside this file, create a functional component named Header.
    3. The Footer component should return <footer> element with a <p> containing the text "Website By Aman Yadav"
    
  Step 3 : Create a MainContent Component.
    1. Create a new file called MainContent.jsx.
    2. Inside this file, create a functional component named MainContent.
    3. The MainContent component should return a <main> element containing:
      - A <h2> element with the text "Main Content"
      - A <p> element with the any text of your choice. e.g "This is coming from Main content."

  Step 4 : Render Components Inside App.jsx
  1. In your App.jsx file, import the Header, MainContent, Footer components.
    
    ```jsx
      import Header from "./components/Header";
      import MainContent from "./components/MainContent";
      import Footer from "./components/Footer";
    ```

  2. Inside the App component's return statment render the three components inside a single <div>, in the following order:
      - Header
      - MainContent
      - Footer

  Your App.jsx should look like this :-
  
  ```jsx
  const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* importing all the components for the Excercise task, in an correct order */}
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```
